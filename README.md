## Introduction

Welcome to the **KGQA Project**! This project is a cutting-edge **Knowledge Graph-based Question Answering** system designed to provide accurate and insightful answers to user queries by leveraging structured knowledge from a comprehensive knowledge graph.

Whether you're building a chatbot, enhancing search capabilities, or developing an intelligent assistant, KGQA offers a robust solution to understand and respond to complex questions.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes and interprets user queries in natural language.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Utilizes a rich knowledge graph to fetch relevant information.
- **Semantic Search**: Enhances search accuracy by understanding the context and semantics of queries.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data and high query volumes.
- **Customization**: Easily extendable to integrate with various data sources and knowledge bases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive API endpoints for seamless integration with applications.

## Architecture

The KGQA system is built on a modular architecture comprising the following components:

1. **Query Processor**: Parses and interprets user queries.
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identifies and extracts key entities from the queries.
3. **Knowledge Graph Connector**: Interfaces with the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant data.
4. **Answer Generator**: Constructs coherent and concise answers based on retrieved information.
5. **API Layer**: Exposes endpoints for interacting with the KGQA system.
